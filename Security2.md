# json web token vs csrf token
### JSON Web Token (JWT) vs. CSRF Token: Key Differences

Both JWT and CSRF tokens are mechanisms used to secure web applications, but they serve different purposes and operate in different contexts. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **Purpose and Use Case**
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**:
    - **Purpose**: JWT is mainly used for **authentication** and **authorization** in stateless applications.
    - **Use Case**: Once a user is authenticated (usually via login), a JWT is issued by the server, and it is passed with every subsequent request to authenticate the user and authorize actions. It's commonly used in APIs where session management is stateless.

- **CSRF Token (Cross-Site Request Forgery Token)**:
    - **Purpose**: CSRF tokens are used to **prevent CSRF attacks** in stateful applications where the session is managed via cookies.
    - **Use Case**: CSRF tokens are generated by the server and sent to the client to include in sensitive HTTP requests (e.g., form submissions) to ensure that requests are legitimate and not forged by malicious websites.

---

### 2. **Type of Protection**
- **JWT**:
    - **Protects Authentication**: JWT authenticates users and confirms their identity for every request they make. It typically includes user information or claims, allowing the server to determine what actions the user is authorized to perform.

- **CSRF Token**:
    - **Protects Against CSRF Attacks**: CSRF tokens are designed specifically to prevent CSRF attacks, where an attacker tricks a user into performing unintended actions in a web application where they are authenticated.

---

### 3. **Storage**
- **JWT**:
    - **Client-Side Storage**: JWTs are often stored in the browser (e.g., localStorage or sessionStorage) or cookies. Since JWTs are self-contained (they contain all the necessary claims or user data), they can be used in stateless applications.

- **CSRF Token**:
    - **Server-Side Storage**: CSRF tokens are typically stored server-side in the user's session. When a request is made (like a form submission), the server checks if the CSRF token sent from the client matches the one stored in the session.

---

### 4. **Transmission**
- **JWT**:
    - **Sent in HTTP Headers**: JWTs are usually sent in the HTTP `Authorization` header with each request (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).

- **CSRF Token**:
    - **Sent in HTTP Request Body or Headers**: CSRF tokens are often included as hidden form fields or sent in a custom header (e.g., `X-CSRF-Token`) with sensitive requests (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE requests).

---

### 5. **Structure**
- **JWT**:
    - **Structured Token**: JWTs are structured and consist of three parts:
        1. **Header**: Specifies the algorithm used for signing the token (e.g., HS256).
        2. **Payload**: Contains claims or user information (e.g., user ID, roles).
        3. **Signature**: A cryptographic signature that ensures the token has not been tampered with.

  Example of JWT:
   ```text
   eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
   ```

- **CSRF Token**:
    - **Opaque Token**: CSRF tokens are usually random, unpredictable strings that have no specific structure or meaning. They are just used for comparison between the server and the client.

  Example of CSRF Token:
   ```text
   2398472hd98234hjdfeuh234
   ```

### 6. **Stateless vs. Stateful**
- **JWT**:
    - **Stateless**: JWTs enable stateless authentication because the server doesn’t need to maintain a session. All necessary information is included within the token itself.

- **CSRF Token**:
    - **Stateful**: CSRF tokens require a session to be maintained on the server, where the token is stored and verified against the one sent by the client.

---

### 7. **Security Implications**
- **JWT**:
    - **Risk of Exposure**: JWTs are sensitive and should be securely stored. If a JWT is stolen (e.g., from localStorage or an unsecured cookie), the attacker can impersonate the user.
    - **Prevention**: JWTs can be made more secure by using techniques like short expiration times and refresh tokens. They should also be stored in `HttpOnly` and `Secure` cookies to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks.

- **CSRF Token**:
    - **Protects State-Managed Apps**: CSRF tokens mitigate CSRF attacks, which exploit user sessions. If the CSRF token is missing or doesn’t match the server’s version, the request is rejected.
    - **Limited to Same-Origin Requests**: CSRF tokens are not effective for stateless apps like those using JWTs, where cookies are not relied upon for authentication.

---

### 8. **Common Usage**
- **JWT**:
    - **Used in API Authentication**: JWTs are commonly used in API-based applications, such as single-page applications (SPAs) where the front-end and back-end are separate. They provide stateless authentication that scales well across distributed systems.

- **CSRF Token**:
    - **Used in Web Forms**: CSRF tokens are more common in traditional server-rendered web applications where cookies are used for session management (e.g., in forms that submit data).

### Conclusion:

- **JWT** is used for **authentication** and **authorization** in stateless systems, particularly when implementing APIs. It allows the application to scale without relying on server-side sessions.

- **CSRF Token** is used in stateful applications to prevent **cross-site request forgery** attacks by ensuring that the request originates from the legitimate user and not a malicious site.

In modern web applications, if you use JWTs with `Authorization` headers, you typically don't need CSRF tokens since you're not relying on cookies, which are the primary attack vector for CSRF attacks. However, in applications that use cookies for session management, **both JWTs for authentication** and **CSRF tokens for request validation** may be necessary.
